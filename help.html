          <br />
          <p>
            <a href="./dashboard.html" class="blue_text">Join</a> is a
            kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group
            of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at
            the
            <a

            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
            method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
            efficiency (or flow).
            <a href="./dashboard.html" class="blue_text">Join</a> leverages the
            principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects
            in an intuitive, visual interface.<br />
            <br />
            It is important to note that
            <a href="./dashboard.html" class="blue_text">Join</a> is designed as
            an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business
            usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience,

          <h3>How to use it</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
            <a href="./dashboard.html" class="blue_text">Join</a>:
          </p>
          <br />
          <div>
            <div class="enumeration">
              <h3>1.</h3>
              <p>
                <b>Exploring the Board</b><br />
                When you log in to
                <a href="./dashboard.html" class="blue_text">Join</a>, you'll
                find a default board. This board represents your project and
                contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await
                feedback” and "Done".
              </p>
            </div>
            <br />
            <div class="enumeration">
              <h3>2.</h3>
              <p>
                <b>Creating Contacts</b><br />
                In <a href="./dashboard.html" class="blue_text">Join</a>, you
                can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the
                "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the
                required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
                tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
              </p>
            </div>
            <br />
            <div class="enumeration">
              <h3>3.</h3>
              <p>
                <b>Adding Cards</b><br />
                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
                Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
                appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details
                in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
                etc.
              </p>
            </div>
            <br />
            <div class="enumeration">
              <h3>4.</h3>
              <p>
                <b>Moving Cards</b><br />
                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect
                that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one
                list to another.
              </p>
            </div>
            <br />
            <div class="enumeration">
              <h3>5.</h3>
              <p>
                <b>Deleting Cards</b><br />
                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
                list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it
                from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as
                this action is irreversible.<br />
                <br />
                Remember that using
                <a href="./dashboard.html" class="blue_text">Join</a>
                effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team
                to ensure the board reflects the current state of your
                project.<br />
