          <p>
            <strong>Legal bases for processing under the GDPR:</strong> Below
            you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we
            process personal data. Please note that in addition to the
            provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may
            apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. If, in
            addition, more specific legal bases are applicable in individual
            cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f
                GDPR)</strong
              >
              - Processing is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of
              the controller or a third party, unless the interests or
              fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, which require
              the protection of personal data, outweigh those interests.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>National data protection regulations in Germany:</strong> In
            addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national
            data protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes in
            particular the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG). In the BDSG, in
            particular, there are special regulations on the right to
            information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the
            processing of special categories of personal data, processing for
            other purposes and transmission as well as automated decision-making
            in individual cases including profiling. In addition, state data
            protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.

            The following overview summarizes the types of data processed and
            the purposes of their processing and refers to the data subjects.

          <h2 id="m27">Security measures</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in
            accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the
            state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope,
            circumstances and purposes of processing as well as the different
            probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the
            rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level
            of protection appropriate to the risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality,
            integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and
            electronic access to the data as well as access, input, disclosure,
            availability and separation thereof. Furthermore, we have
            established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects'
            rights, the deletion of data and responses to data threats. We also
            take the protection of personal data into account as early as the
            development or selection of hardware, software and procedures, in
            accordance with the principle of data protection through technology
            design and through data protection-friendly default settings.

              provisions. Where personal data are processed for direct marketing
              purposes, you have the right to object at any time to processing
              of personal data concerning you for such marketing, which includes
              profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct

              data in accordance with legal requirements.
